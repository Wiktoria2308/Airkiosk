# Airkiosk
The internship project for a company in Poland.

My project was to build an HTML template according to the attached mock-up using: Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, Sass, JavaScript.

To run a project, first go to the terminal or command-line and change the folder to the project folder (cd Airkiosk).

Then install the http server, for this purpose, enter: npm install http-server.

(If you do not have the npm package installed, type in the terminal: npm install npm @ latest -g. Or you can install node.js which already contains npm, then go to the website: https://nodejs.org/en/ and download the appropriate package for our computer.)

Then start the server: http-server [path] [options]. I use the command: http-server -c-1

The following information will appear: Starting up http-server, serving ./ Available on: http://127.0.0.1:8080 http://192.168.0.103:8080

We open the browser and enter the selected address, e.g. http://127.0.0.1:8080.

Then select from the list: airkiosk.html

And we see a working site. Launching the server allows you to display products in the carousel in Airkiosk. Thanks to this, information about CORS is not displayed to us.
